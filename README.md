# Advent of Code 2018 in Rust

I wanted to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) so I thought I'd try to
do Advent of Code in it (inspired to do so by [BurntSushi's repo](https://github.com/BurntSushi/advent-of-code)).

These answers will probably not be idiomatic since I'm just learning. So if you
happen to stumble upon this and know Rust, let me know how to do it like a real
[Rustacean](https://www.rustaceans.org/).
